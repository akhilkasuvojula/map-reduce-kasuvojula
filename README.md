## Data Set
The dataset contains the data regarding covid cases. It has 5 columns with iso_code,continent,location,date and total_cases. It shows the data which shows covid cases reported on different dates.
## Analysis
I have used mapping technique to fetch the data from the excel and i have mapped two columns ie location, total_cases to the output file. Then i have used reducer to get the count of total cases from each location.
